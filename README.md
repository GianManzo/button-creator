 The code starts by creating a variable called handleStyle.
 
 This is an object that has properties for the background color, height, width, border radius and font size of the button element.
 
 The code then creates a function called handleChange which will change the values of these properties based on user input.
 
 
 The next line in the code is where it gets interesting: "const name = event.target."
 
 What this means is that when you click on any part of the button (the text or its shape), we want to set all those properties to what was clicked on.
 So if you click on 'text', then we want to set our text property to whatever value was clicked into it; if you click on 'shape', then we want to set our shape property  with whatever value was clicked into it as well as changing its background color and so forth.
 
 The code is a simple example of how to store and retrieve values from localStorage.
 
 The handleStyle object is created with the following properties: element - The DOM element that will be affected by the style change, in this case, it's the button.
 
 backgroundColor(value) - Sets the background color of the button to whatever value you pass in.
 
 height(value) - Sets the height of the button to whatever value you pass in.
 
 width(value) - Sets the width of the button to whatever value you pass in.
 
 border(value) - Sets a border around an element, like so: .element { border: 5px solid red; }
